"You will create a set of Math operators (+, -, /, *,pow and remainder) by getting the TWO input numbers
from the user and printing out the result on the command windows in MS Visual Studio 2022 community,
each Math operator result must be printed in a different background and foreground color."

Requirements and rough idea on how to go about it.

1. Figure rough layout for the calculator.
2. Declare the variables in the main function
3. introduce what the console application is and what it does.
4. sort out the console 'gui' layout
5. Work out how to do the maths for the calculations.
6. sort out how the user chooses what numerical manipulation method they want
7. make it so you can have strings as well as the number choosen i.e 1 (add) and also able to type the word 'Add' 
to add.
8. Sort the calculations into a switch statement with individual cases containing the seperate mathmatic code.
9. output the values of the numbers added manipulated into the console and have the console print the
seperate manipulation methods in differnt colours as per the rubric.
10. Have the console state that the calculation is finished and the program must be relaunched to do another 
calculation. 


Steps 1 through to 10 are complete and functioning. 

Final notes - Could have made the interface easier to understand and had the Notes dissapear after the calculation
writelines started to happen.
